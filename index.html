            <h1>Word appetit!</h1>

            <h2>Game</h2>

            <p>The customer has ordered a word! Pick the letters that the cook is throwing and
            deliver them to the customer's table.</p>

            <p>Every new letter you deliver will give you 100 points, but be careful with
            repeated letters! You will lose 50 points if you deliver those. There are bonus
            points for bringing as many letters as possible in the same delivery: 10 extra
            points for the second letter, 20 for the third one, etc.</p>

            <p>Levels have a score goal, which will allow you to progress to the next one. As
            you advance, words will be longer and score goals more tight.</p>

            <h2>Controls</h2>

            <p>Use the arrows to move the waiter left and right. Letters will stack up as they
            fall on your plate, to deliver them just go to the customer's table.</p>
